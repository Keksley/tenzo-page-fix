        <p class = "lyrics__text">"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
            One of the four beasts saying,
            'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold a white horse"
            There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
            And he decides who to free and who to blame
            Everybody won't be treated all the same
            There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
            When the man comes around
            The hairs on your arm will stand up
            At the terror in each sip and in each sup
            Will you partake of that last offered cup
            Or disappear into the potter's ground?
            When the man comes around
            Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
            One hundred million angels singin'
            Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
            Voices callin', voices cryin'
            Some are born and some are dyin'
            It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
            And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
            The virgins are all trimming their wicks
            The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
            It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
            Till armageddon no shalam, no shalom
            Then the father hen will call his chickens home
            The wise man will bow down before the throne
            And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
            When the man comes around
            Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
            Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
            Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
            Listen to the words long written down
            When the man comes around
            Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
            One hundred million angels singin'
            Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
            Voices callin', voices cryin'
            Some are born and some are dyin'
            It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
            And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
            The virgins are all trimming their wicks
            The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
            It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
            In measured hundredweight and penny pound
            When the man comes around
            "And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
            And I looked, and behold a pale horse
            And his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him"</p>
